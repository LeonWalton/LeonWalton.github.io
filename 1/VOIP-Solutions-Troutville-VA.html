<p>Still, with so much choice offered, and with a lot lingo surrounding the topic of office telephones, it can be tough to understand where to begin. While Digital Phone Systems are useful and hassle-free; they're not mobile. Nevertheless, if your business must abide by security regulations that need information to be kept on-site, then a hosted service is probably not the best option. The only distinction between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower cost of today's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the traditional phone networks (the conventional phone lines) instead of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
<p>Profits that you would normally spend on hardware such as servers and phones are included in your regular monthly service. For example, if User A were to be transferred from Office A to Office B, they would merely take their phone with them and plug it into the cable television connection in office B. The system would then search for the MAC Address of the device on the network, and once located, would deliver the calls to that place without any additional programs on the system.</p>
