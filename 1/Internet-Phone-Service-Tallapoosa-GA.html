<p>Database Systems Corp Nevertheless, today the variety of office phone systems for small business is huge and are based upon various technology platforms. More than a 3rd of companies now use VoIP as their go-to system. A hosted system supplies all PBX services, features and applications, and it maintains software in the cloud rather than on a server like digital systems.
