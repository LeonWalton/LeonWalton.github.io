<p>As we all know, VoIP is among the hottest topics in the telecom market that has actually altered the way individuals think about interactions. A PBX system paths incoming calls to the suitable extension in an office. Voice over IP converts your voice into a digital signal, compresses it, and sends it over the internet. Medium-sized and small companies like yours require the exact same innovative and trusted interaction solutions as big companies do, however without the high costs or frustrating complexity.
