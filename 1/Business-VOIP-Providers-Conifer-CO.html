An incredibly popular approach for numerous big companies would be to make use of both the mobility and flexibility of a hosted option, with the security, consistency, and control of an on-premise traditional PBX. A cloud phone system is a terrific fit for any entrepreneur, and Insect's system will grow with your business, allowing you to focus on running it.
