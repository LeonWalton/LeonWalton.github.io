<p>VoIP phone service has actually been around for some time as business owners and services switch from telephone services that use PSTN (Public Changed Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. There is a huge range of VoIP providers on the internet which offer SIP trunking (telephone systems services) for cheaper call rates than traditional telephone providers. The software and hardware is cost-efficient, too, for VoIP phone systems. In addition, cordless "hot spots" in locations such as parks, coffee shops, and airports permit you to connect to the Internet and might allow you to utilize VoIP service wirelessly.</p>
<p>An IP-based PBX service can see the user from anywhere based upon IP protocols, so the user has a virtualized experience and distributed voice calls.
